                    <h1>The Use of Printing as a Means of Self Preservation</h1>
                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>The invention of the movable type printer by Johannes Gutenberg in the fifteenth century played a significant role in transforming the social and political state in Europe. Armenian leaders recognized the significance of printing as a medium for communication and used it as a tool to struggle against foreign political and religious threats. Given that the prevailing socio-political climate did not permit the development of a printing industry in the homeland, the leaders developed their projects in European economic and cultural centres where the printing industry was already flourishing.</p>
                    <p>This article describes the social and political events in Europe following the invention of the printer, and how those events impact the development of Armenian printing in Europe. It describes the political situation in Armenia during that period, and the drive of Armenian leaders to use printing to promote spiritual and national revival. The article concludes by describing the results attained by Armenian printers in Europe, showing their contribution to the renewal of religious and national consciousness and the rebirth of Armenian culture.</p>
                    <h2>Preface</h2>
                    <p>In our everyday lives we experience certain inventions or innovations that play a fundamental role in shaping society. Any innovation that drives fundamental changes to how society functions has its positive and negative sides. Complainants naturally point to its damaging effects, and the other camp simply benefits from the opportunities that the innovation creates.</p>
                    <p>The period in which we live is an excellent example of transformation brought by innovative technologies. We find ourselves in the grip of the internet revolution. The internet and social media, through their ubiquity, have penetrated almost all aspects of our lives, be they social, communication, economic, scientific, etc. Although some of us may not appreciate the value of Amazon, Google or Facebook, these companies, which were unimaginable just twenty years ago, have revolutionized how we communicate, promote culture, run our businesses and disseminate scientific knowledge.</p>
                    <p>We read in the news how in some countries, like Egypt and Libya, revolutionaries use social media to organize their activities, spread their ideology and rise up against their governments. We learn how they instantaneously spread their latest updates and points of view to the world through Facebook or Twitter. We also learn how the ruling governments resist the demands of the insurgents by censoring or restricting the use of these media, or by spying, using the same methods.</p>
                    <h2>The Invention of Printing and Europe</h2>
                    <p>The invention of the movable type printer by Johannes Gutenberg (1398-1498) in the middle of the fifteenth century also contributed to widespread social change in Europe and especially in Germany. For the first time in history, it became possible to print a book faster than it took to read one. The cost of purchasing a book dropped to a quarter, thanks to the use of paper<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> and printing. Families with modest incomes could now afford to own their own books.</p>
                    <p>It is estimated that by 1500, just fifty years after Gutenberg's invention, nine million books had already been printed, compared to the few tens of thousands of existing handwritten books that were locked up in monasteries or the libraries of wealthy families. In 1510, some 200 printers were known to operate in Venice, where books in many languages, such as Slavonic, Hebrew and Arabic, were published. Venetian merchants produced books as a consumer product, for profit, and not necessarily to spread spiritual or intellectual enlightenment.</p>
                    <p>The proliferation of spiritual books, especially those that were translated from Latin to local languages, popularized religion, increased religious awareness, and accelerated the exchange and spread of ideas. As a result, the control and influence of leaders of the Roman Catholic Church in interpreting and communicating religious ideas gradually decreased. The printer allowed the publication and distribution of Martin Luther's (1483-1546) doctrinal grievances (Ninety-five Theses) against Rome in 1517, and set in motion the Protestant Reformation or Revolution. In the escalating conflict between the two sides, followers of the Protestant movement benefited from the opportunities the printing allowed them by publishing and distributing their anti-Roman ideology to the German population.</p>
                    <p>The ruling class and Rome quickly awakened to the disruptive influence that the Protestant movement and its use of printing had on the established social order and governmental authority. Rome responded to the emerging threat by taking a number of steps. In 1545, Pope Paul III convened the Council of Trent, through which the Catholic Church enacted a number of changes that we now identify as the Counter Reformation or Catholic Restoration, it reviewed the rules governing its internal operations, and reconfirmed its doctrine and sacraments.</p> 
                    <p>The Church established the Inquisition of Italy, through which it prosecuted not just heretics, but also those who expressed any reasonable question about the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and the infallibility of the Pope. By the order of Pope Paul IV, it condemned deviant books, and in 1559 it published the <i>Index librorum</i> prohibitorum, a list of forbidden books that could threaten the souls of anyone reading them. The list ended up including works such as the writings of Erasmus<sup><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>, Nicolaus Copernicus' De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, Galileo Galilei's Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo and the Quran. By 1565 almost three quarters of all books published in Europe were banned, and according to ecclesiastical canon, publishers were required to obtain the Pope's permission before they could print a book.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting that the escalating conflict did not put an end to scholarly and popular works or prevent European civilization from flourishing. Instead, the proliferation of spiritual books among the common people, especially the higher quality translations of the Bible<sup><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>, set a higher standard for linguistic expression, and helped enrich the French, German and English languages. New methods and topics of expression emerged, such as fictional and political novels, the study of classical languages and natural sciences.</p>
                    <h2>The Situation in Armenia</h2>
                    <p>While Western Europe was experiencing its intellectual and scientific Renaissance, the Armenian nation was living through one of the darkest and most hopeless periods in its history. The invasions of Turkic and Mongol peoples in the late Middle Ages had been followed by a series of power struggles between various Muslim powers. Mamluks, Ottomans, Black and White Sheep tribal confederations and the Timurids engaged in a power struggle for an extended time.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, two powerful empires emerged; Ottoman Turkey and Safavid Persia battled for supremacy in Anatolia, the Southern Caucasus and Mesopotamia for nearly one and a half centuries<sup><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>. The extended conflict led to widespread destruction of property, forced conversions of Christian subjects to Islam and mass resettlement of populations. The contemporary Armenian historian Arakel Tavrizetsi (Առաքել Դաւրիժեցի, 1590-1670) emotionally describes the first invasion of Shah Abbas I in 1603, during which the Persian king forcefully displaces the entire Armenian population of eastern Armenia to Persia: “With my own eyes I witnessed the destruction of Armenia, the dwindling of our nation and the evils of the Mohammedans.” The destruction in the region spread during the continuing conflict between Shah Abbas and Ottoman Cağaloğlu Pasha, and the ensuing famine. Tavrizetsi describes the plight of the population in his history: “and the Armenian nation was dispersed; and they left to find places where they could live and survive.</p>
                    <p>The emigration of the Armenian population, which had started much earlier, increased to an exodus following the invasions and rule of the Seljuks and Mongols in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Thousands of Armenians migrated to Italy, France, Holland, Crimea, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Persia and India. Gradually, the Armenian people dwindled into a minority on its own ancestral land, and its social, economic and cultural life disintegrated. Its ruling class was either eradicated or deemed untrustworthy by the population because of its subservience to the ruling despots.</p>
                    <h2>The Urge to Print</h2>
                    <p>Leaders of the Armenian Church recognized the importance of printing and used it to carry out their spiritual mission and the preservation of the Armenian national identity. They used printed materials to train and educate new generations of clergy, knowing that only well prepared members could prevail in these adverse conditions and reverse the effects of political and religious pressures.</p>
                    <p>The struggle against foreign religions and doctrines was not new. Ever since the Middle Ages, Armenian universities played a significant role not only as educational institutions, but also as political ones. The universities at Gladzor (Գլաձոր) and Tatev (Տաթեւ) brought up a class of clergy and intellectuals that led the effort to promote and protect the national doctrine, language, culture and tradition. Scribes labouring at these universities copied large numbers of manuscripts and distributed them to different parts of the country as a form of self preservation, knowing that many of them would be destroyed during repeated invasions of barbaric tribes.</p>
                    <p>By the sixteenth century printing had already emerged as the dominant method for communicating cultural and religious subjects. The Roman Catholic Church was using printed material not only to fight against the spread of Protestantism, but it was using its missionary college, the <i>Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide</i>, to print religious material in Armenian to convert Armenians in Europe and the general population in Armenia.</p>
                    <p>Catholicos Stephanos V Salmasdetsi (Ստեփանոս Ե. Սալմաստեցի), Supreme Patriarch of the Armenian Church was the first among Armenian leaders who aspired to benefit from the printer. In 1547, he convened a secret council at the Holy See of Etchmiadzin (Էջմիածին) to discuss the destructive effects of Ottoman and Persian policies, and the liberation of the Armenian people from their oppressive rule. Based on the decisions of the Council, the Catholicos departed for Europe to seek help for his people. The delegation first arrived in Venice, where the Catholicos met with the Doge of the Republic and handed him the letter known as “Supplication of the Armenian Lords”. Salmasdetsi then went to Rome, where he held political negotiations with Pope Paul III, and after the latter's death, with Pope Julius III. Having received a letter of recommendation from the Pope, Salmasdetsi then left for Germany to confer with Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who, at the time, was preoccupied by the unrest caused by Luther’s teachings and the Protestant movement. The Catholicos then continued to Poland to raise funds from the Armenian Diaspora established there, and then to Russia. He returned to Armenia empty handed in 1550.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt that one of Salmasdetsi's goals for traveling to Europe was his desire to become familiar with developing technologies and the opportunities they offered. During his stay in Venice, Salmasdetsi learned about the printing industry and brought back essential information about it to Armenia. It is very likely that it was based on his experience and instructions that in 1562 his successor, Catholicos Michael Sebastatsi (Միքայէլ Սեբաստացի) convened a second secret council, this time in Sebastea, where it was decided to send Abgar Tokhatetsi (Abgar Dpir) to Europe to pursue not only political objectives, but also the development of an Armenian press.</p>
                    <p>During the following century, Armenian efforts to establish printing presses continued with interruptions in Western Europe and Persia. Following the signing of the Treaty of Zuhab between the Ottoman and Persian Empires, security in Armenia began to improve. The Armenian Church began to revive the education of new clergy and made a significant effort to re-establish monastic and cultural institutions.</p>
                    <p>In the Armenian community of New Julfa (Նոր Ջուղա) near Isfahan, Persia, the Primate of the Armenian Church, Khachatur Kesaratsi (Խաչատուր Կեսարացի) established the first Armenian press outside of Europe around 1636. His motivation for doing so is captured in the colophon of one of the books he published there, where he writes: “This most contented priest sees the development of printing among the Latin nations, and yearns that it may also exist among the Armenians."</p>
                    <p>Catholicos Hakob (James) IV Jughayetsi (Յակոբ Դ. Ջուղայեցի) rekindled the effort to establish a printing press and publish the Holy Bible for distribution in Armenia. Having studied under Khachatur Kesaratsi in New Julfa, Jughayetsi was heavily influenced by his teacher's views and strong sense of patriotism. In just the second year of his reign, in 1657, Jughayetsi sent his secretary, Mattheos Dzaretsi (Մատթէոս Ծարեցի), and following the latter's death, Voskan Yerevantsi (Ոսկան Երեւանցի) to Europe to establish a permanent Armenian press. Yerevantsi completed Dzaretsi's effort to publish the Holy Bible in Amsterdam in 1666 and completed it in 1668.</p>
                    <p>The printing press finally arrived in Armenia through the audacious efforts of Catholicos Simeon Yerevantsi (Սիմէոն Երեւանցի). S. Yerevantsi, an educated and well travelled man, who had, in his earlier years, served in Madras and Istanbul, where he had become familiar with the benefits of the press. It was through his efforts, and the financial support of a wealthy Armenian merchant from India, Grigor Mikaelyan Chakigiants, that the necessary infrastructure was gradually built up in Etchmiadzin, and the first book, a prayer book called <i>Spiritual Recreation</i> (Զբոսարան Հոգեւոր) was published in 1772.</p>
                    <h2>Spiritual Sensorship</h2>
                    <p>The protestant movement started by Martin Luther, John (Jean) Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli resulted in significant ideological, political and military turmoil in Europe. The steps that the Roman Catholic Church took to overcome the expanding influence of the protestant doctrines complicated the development and expansion of Armenian presses. The policies that were made during the Council of Trent resulted in a political posture that was less flexible and less conciliatory towards the publication of any religious material that did not conform to the Roman Catholic doctrine.</p>
                    <p>The effects of censorship were slow to appear. It is likely that Hakob Meghapart (Յակոբ Մեղապարտ), who was the first to publish Armenian books, did not have to face Roman censors when he set off to publish the first five Armenian books in Venice during 1512-1513, given that his short lived enterprise operated when printing was still developing without any restrictions, just before the turmoil that Luther and his followers triggered.</p>
                    <p>Abgar Tokhatetsi arrived in Venice half a century after Meghapart, at a time when the Council of Trent and the Roman Inquisition had begun to have their influence on Rome's policies. Tokhatetsi was obliged to travel to Rome to meet with Pope Pius IV and to ask his permission to print. The Pope was not satisfied with the letters of recommendation that Tokhatetsi had brought with him from Catholicos Michael Sebastatsi. He demanded Tokhatetsi to confirm the doctrine of the Armenian Church in writing; to prove that Armenians were “true and acceptable” Christians. It was only after conforming with that request that Tokhatetsi received the Pope's blessings to publish religious books in Venice. However, Tokhatetsi was forced to move his press away from Venice following the death of Pope Pius IV, because his successor, Pope Pius V was a former inquisitor and did not give Tokhatetsi the sponsorship he needed to continue his work.</p>
                    <p>Rome insisted that for it to provide political assistance and the permission to publish religious books, the Armenian Church should, according to a twelfth century agreement<sup><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>, accept the supremacy of the Pope and the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, and that the translation and contents of the Armenian Bible should correspond to that of the Latin Vulgate<sup><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>. The response of the Armenian Church to these demands remained non-committal and focused only around national and political issues; its statements simply clarified the doctrine of the Armenian Church.</p>
                    <p>The article of faith that Abgar Tokhatetsi presented to Pope Pius IV in 1563 is an excellent example of the Armenian response. In it Tokhatetsi offers the allegiance of the Armenian Church to Rome, stressing that the doctrinal differences between the Armenian and the Roman Catholic Church were insignificant. However, he does not hesitate to point out that the Armenian Church recognizes only the first three Universal Ecumenical Councils, that of Nicaea (AD 325), Constantinople (AD 381) and Ephesus (AD 431). He does not make any references to the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) and the Chalcedonian doctrine<sup><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup>. Tokhatetsi concludes his creed with the following statement: “We Armenians, who have been enslaved by the rule of the Turks and Persians, have these beliefs and shall keep them.” It is interesting that Pope Pius IV accepts Tokhatetsi's creed without objections and grants him the permission to design Armenian fonts and print religious books.</p>
                    <p>The solution to Rome's spiritual censorship is found in 1658 when Mattheos Dzaretsi, after having failed to obtain permission from Venetian and Roman officials for thirteen months departs for Amsterdam, where he signs a contract with Christopher Von Dyck and begins the preparatory work to publish Armenian books. The decision to move the effort to Amsterdam had been foreseen some twenty years earlier by the Armenian translator of the Venetian Ambassador to Izmir (Smyrna), who guessed that the “heretical protestant Dutch” would be more accommodating to print the Armenian Bible.</p>
                    <p>After two years of backbreaking work, Dzaretsi finally finds himself in a position to start printing the Bible in 1660, but he falls ill and dies without attaining his goal. Fortunately, the print shop is saved by an Armenian merchant established in Amsterdam, Avetis Ghlijents (Աւետիս Ղլիճենց), who pays off Dzaretsi's debts and asks Catholicos Hakob IV for help to continue the operation of the press. The Catholicos sends Dzaretsi's brother, Voskan Yerevantsi to Amsterdam, who, after a handful of smaller projects, resumes the effort to print the Bible in 1666 and completes the “crown of early Armenian printing” in 1668.</p>
                    <p>Voskan Yerevantsi bases his publication on the 1295 manuscript of the Bible owned by King Hetum II (Հեթում Բ., 1266-1307). He compares the text with that of the Latin Vulgate, and appends to it, using his own translations, those sections that were not included as per the Armenian canon. He does this so that the books would not be confiscated by Roman censors as they were being transported from Amsterdam to Armenia through Roman controlled territories. It is interesting that there are two copies of this Bible in existence that were printed by Yerevantsi in the same year and the same printer, that exclude the sections that were not included in the fifth century Armenian translation; a shrewd step that Yerevantsi took to avoid censorship.</p>
                    <h2>The Legacy of Armenian Printers</h2>
                    <p>In the history of European printing, the years between the invention of printing by Gutenberg and 1500 are considered to be its development period. Books printed during those years are known as incunables or incunabula, which means swaddling clothes or cradle. The year 1500 is an arbitrary selection and does not reflect any notable developments in the printing process around the year 1500. Many books printed for a number of years after 1500 continued to be visually indistinguishable from incunables.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Vrej Nersessian, Curator at the British Library in London, suggests that the development period of Armenian printing extends from 1512 to 1660. The end coincides with the establishment of the Armenian printer by Mattheos Dzaretsi in Amsterdam. During its development years, efforts progressed with interruptions; undertakers were separated by years and by distance, and did not have the opportunity to collaborate; their efforts remained isolated and faded away following their departure from the business. But then, in the seventeenth century, the process began to mature and showed characteristics that could be described through the following points:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The undertaking of publication changed from being the heroic efforts of individuals and became the result of collaborative efforts. Voskan Yerevantsi's press was the first that continued and expanded its operations even after the death of its founder. Several of Yerevantsi's collaborators, Soghomon Levonian (Սողոմոն Լեւոնեան), Petros Latinatsi (Պետրոս Լատինացի), Naseeb Grigorian (Նասիպ Գրիգորեան) and Mattheos Vanandetsi (Մատթէոս Վանանդեցի) went on to establish their own presses in Marseille, Istanbul, Venice and Amsterdam.</li>
                        <li>Print houses were passed from generation to generation and operated as successful businesses for many years. The presses of Grigor Marzvanetsi (Գրիգոր Մարզուանեցի), Astvadzatur Dpir (Աստուածատուր Դպիր) and Poghos Arabian (Պօղոս Արապեան) are excellent examples of these success stories. </li>
                        <li>The list of published books grew significantly. Secular books were printed in addition to the religious and spiritual books. Armenian printing was no longer an essential medium for religious-ideological struggle; it became a means for high quality expression and production.</li>
                        <li>Books were printed to meet the daily needs of common people, such as the World Atlas (Համատարած Աշխարհացոյց) published by the Vanandetsis in 1695. The Vanandetsis clarified the purpose of their print with the following statement: “for the needs of merchants, especially those of the Armenian nation.”</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>It is likely that the transformation of Armenian printing would not have happened without the selfless and productive contributions of Mattheos Dzaretsi, Avetis Ghlijents, Voskan Yerevantsi, and the heirs of the latter's printer, the Vanandetsi family. It was thanks to their work that a large volume of books were printed in Western Europe and transported to Armenia, Poland, and many other centres with large Armenian communities. Records show that during one of his journeys to Armenia, Ghlijents brought with him 1200 copies of Jesus the Son (Յիսուս Որդի), 2700 copies of The Book of Psalms (Սաղմոս), and 3000 copies of The Book of Hours (Ժամագիրք). Over the years deliveries like these increased the availability of books and played a significant role in revitalizing the spiritual and national self awareness of the Armenian people.</p>
                    <p>Here, I'd like to stop and reflect upon the legacy of Voskan Yerevantsi and the Vanandetsis.</p>
                    <h3>Voskan Yerevantsi</h3>
                    <p>Voskan Yerevantsi was an influential intellectual and cleric, who possessed considerable vigour and patriotism. In 1662, Catholicos Hakob IV Jughayetsi sent him to Amsterdam to continue the work that was started by Mattheos Dzaretsi and Avetis Ghlijents, and ultimately print the Holy Bible in Armenian. Once in Amsterdam, Yerevantsi ordered new fonts and decorations, and began the work of printing the Bible in 1666, which he completed in 1668.</p>
                    <p>After completing the publication of the Bible, Yerevantsi printed a number of other religious books. Within a few years he published nineteen titles, among them the first secular books, including Arakel Tavrizetsi's <i>History</i> (Պատմութիւն Առաքել Վարդապետի Դաւրիժեցւոյ) and Anania Shirakatsi's (Անանիա Շիրակացի, 7th century) <i>Geography</i>.</p>
                    <p>To escape his debtors, Yerevantsi moved his press first to Livorno and then to Marseille. Unfortunately the harassment of Roman censors and the demands of his debtors had their impact on his health. He fell ill and died in 1675. Fortunately, his colleagues did not lose hope; they completed the projects that Yerevantsi had already started and went on to print new books. Through their efforts Yerevantsi's press continued to function until 1683.</p>
                    <p>The publication of the Holy Bible occupies a central place in Yerevantsi's harvest. Academician Garegin Levonian describes it as “a wonderful work from a technical point of view and an unprecedented work compared to contemporary publications". Historian Maghakia Ormanian reacts negatively to Yerevantsi's modifications and additions to the text of the Bible, considering them “a disturbance and disfigurement of the elegant translations of our ancestors,” but changes his tone when describing the technical aspects of the publication, considering it a fine, superior and model production. French Armenologist Jean-Pierre Mahé says: "Voskan, in spite of his errors, showed admirable constancy, energy and fixity of purpose."</p>
                    <h3>The Vanandetsis</h3>
                    <p>Mattheos Hovhannisian (Մատթէոս Յովհաննիսեան) was the first of the Vanandetsi family to come to Europe in 1660 to learn typesetting. He laboured in Voskan Yerevantsi's press for fourteen years without pay. After Yerevantsi's death in Marseille, he returned to Amsterdam where he rebuilt Yerevantsi's press and in 1685 published the <i>Book of Hymns</i> (Շարակնոց) and two years later, The <i>Book of Hours</i>. In 1688 he returned to his ancestral town of Vanand in Goghtn, where he convinced his cousin, Bishop Tovmas Nourijanian Vanandetsi (Թովմաս Նուրիջանեան) to resign from his seat as Primate and dedicate himself to printing. Nourijanian is charmed with the glamour of Yerevantsi's work, agrees, and brings with him his two nephews, Ghukas (Ղուկաս) and Michael (Միքայէլ).</p>
                    <p>During their activity in Amsterdam, the Vanandetsis published more than twenty books. In 1695 they published the first Armenian atlas, <i>The World Atlas</i><sup><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>, and a year later, its companion and explanation, <i>Key to the World Atlas</i>. These two books are masterpieces in their category and attest to the rebirth of the Armenian people's interest in the latest European geographic sciences. Historian Leo Babakhanian, impressed by Vanandetsi's <i>Atlas</i>, says: “This great and wonderful work could be considered a significant discovery among our intellectual poverty of that time".</p>
                    <p>In 1695 the Vanandetsis published fifth century historian Movses Khorenatsi's (Մովսէս Խորենացի) <i>History of the Armenians</i> (Պատմութիւն Հայոց). The publication of this book contributed to the rebirth of national awareness and the growth of nationalism. Its translation to foreign languages helped develop the branch of Armenology in Europe, becoming an aide to historical studies and creating attention and curiosity about the nation's ancient past and the circumstances of its existence.</p>
                    <p>The Vanandetsi's attained considerable fame within their industry in Europe. During his stay in Amsterdam, Russian Tsar Peter I Romanov (1672-1725) consulted with Adriaan Schoonebeek (1658-1714), the master engraver employed at the Vanandetsis, to learn about the art of engraving. During those discussions the Tsar learned about the <i>World Atlas</i>, which he had copied and translated to Russian.</p>
                    <p>In 1707 Tovmas Vanandetsi traveled to London. There he met with Queen Anne (1665-1714), and discussed the possibility of establishing an Armenian press in London. On this occasion he was received by Archbishop John Sharp of York, on whose recommendation he was given an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by the University of Oxford.</p>
                    <p>After 1705 the Vanandetsis found their resources dwindling due to lack of sufficient work<sup><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup>. Tovmas Vanandetsi considered moving his press to Armenia, but changed his mind after he determined that the political situation in the region did not yet favour such an action. The press continued to operate for a few more years with the financial backing of various merchants, but shut down in 1711.</p>
                    <h2>Renewal</h2>
                    <p>In the eighteenth century the press spread into Armenian communities established outside Western Europe, such as Istanbul, Madras, and Lvov. Rekindled interest in the Armenian heritage led to the publication of the works of ancient Armenian historians, such as Agatangeghos (Ագաթանգեղոս, 4th century), Pavstos Buzand (Փաւտսոս Բիւզանդ, 5th century), Yeghishé (Եղիշէ, 5th century), Zenob Glak (Զենոբ Գլակ, 4th century), Stepanos Orbelian (Ստեփանոս Օրբելեան, 13th century), as well as religious masters like Grigor Narekatsi (Գրիգոր Նարեկացի, 10-11 century), Yeznik (Եզնիկ, 4-5th century), and Nersess Lambronatsi (Ներսէս Լամբրոնացի, 12th century).</p>
                    <p>The educational and cultural movement growing in those communities conveyed nationalist and patriotic ideas to literature. The advancement in national awareness became more noticeable through verse composed by authors such as Naghash Hovnatan (Նաղաշ Յովնաթան, 1661-1722), Paghtassar Dpir (Պաղտասար Դպիր, 1683-1768) and Petros Ghapantsi (Պետրոս Ղափանցի, d. 1784). The literary language blossomed and gradually came closer to Classical Armenian, and spread the notions of homeland, nation and church through prose, poetry and songs to its readers.</p>
                    <p>Paghtassar Dpir was a noteworthy contributor to this cultural movement. This “graceful and brilliant” man was well known as an educator and linguist working in Istanbul. For many years, he worked at Astvadzatur Dpir's press as an editor, where he oversaw the publication of a large number of classical Armenian authors. Paghtassar Dpir also contributed to the development of Armenian poetry, which he penned using Classical Armenian, yet with such a simple and accessible language that it had the comprehensibility of the vernacular. His Small <i>Songbook</i> (Տաղարան Փոքրիկ, 1723) was reprinted seven times with additions and revisions. Among those songs is one that is titled <i>From Your Royal Slumber Awaken</i>, which is a love song, but metaphorically is an invitation for Armenians to awaken from their stupor and stand up to foreign domination.</p>
                    <p>The Mekhitarist Order (Մխիթարեան Միաբանութիւն) was another major contributor to the renewal of Armenian culture. Fr. Mekhitar Sebastatsi (Մխիթար Սեբաստացի), founder and abbot of the Order, moved his order to the island of St. Lazare, Venice, in 1717, where he built a number of buildings and transformed the former leper colony into a centre of European intellectual enlightenment. Through their dedicated work, the Mekhitarists accomplished what Armenian clerics of the East had strived to achieve two centuries ago. The Mekhitarists established their own printing press in 1788, which they developed and perfected over the years. During the following decades many of their books won international awards, such as in London (1862), Paris (1855, 1867), Venice (1872) and Vienna (1873).</p>
                    <p>Through their extensive cultural output the Mekhitarists earned the honour of being called the publishers of classical Armenian literature. The development and publication of the <i>Dictionary of the Armenian Language</i> in 1749 made an invaluable contribution to Armenian literature and the study of the Armenian language. Mikael Chamchian's (Միքայէլ Չամչեան, 1738-1823) <i>Grammar</i> (1779) and <i>History of the Armenians</i> (Պատմութիւն Հայոց, 1784-1786) increased the reputation of the Order among literary circles. Ghukas Injijian's (Ղուկաս Ինճիճեան, 1758-1833) two studies in Armenian geography (Ստորագրութիւն Հին Հայաստանից, Հնախօսութիւն Աշխարհագրական Հայաստանի) opened up the ancient and modern Armenian world to their students. The Mekhitarists went on to publish hundreds of books, textbooks, historical books, religious books, philosophical books and many others.</p>
                    <p>The renewal was also seen through the growing interest of readers who consumed the fruits of the printing presses. We already saw how Paghtassar Dpir's <i>Songbook</i> was reprinted seven times. The readers' interest is also seen through letters they sent to the publishers, requesting more books. An example of these is a letter to Abbot Melkonian of the Mekhitarist Order, sent by Fr. Sukias Aghamalian from Madras, India, on June 8, 1775, where he writes: “Armenians here are starving for more books. They took all the books that I had and left me with just the <i>Book of Hours</i>. The contents of the box that you had sent me ran out in one minute; they bought all its contents and left me with nothing. Therefore, I plead to you, please send me more books soon; Bibles, Fr. Mekhitar's Dictionary, Grammar… If you send me ten boxes instead of one, all will be sold, just make sure that the boxes are large."</p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The repressive political climate in Armenia during the 14-16th centuries, compounded with the strong influence of Islamic values and morality, and the disfigurement of the Armenian language and culture did not bid a promising future for the Armenian people. It was thanks to the dedicated work of determined and far-sighted clerics that the Armenian nation stepped away from the brink of annihilation, broke free from a state of intellectual darkness, and entered a period of renewal.</p>
                    <p>However, this period wasn't simply the re-emergence of antiquity; it was a period where new and fresh ideas flourished, introducing new and unique expressions into art, literature, society and other aspects of life. It was during this period that the patriotic song was born and the works of Khorenatsi and other classical historians were printed, breathing new life into national awareness and the growing independence movement. In the eighteenth century the Mekhitarists added their genius through their printing press, translations and analytical work, which made the Armenian literature, language and its history accessible to international readers.</p>
                    <p>The intellectual renewal that began during the seventeenth century and grew during the eighteenth established the foundations of what was to become the second golden age of the Armenian nation, its Great Awakening (Զարթօնք).</p>

                    <p id="fn1"><strong>[1]</strong> Vellum was a very expensive material. The skins from hundreds of calves or sheep were needed to create a single book. We know, for example, that 600 calves were consumed to complete the Tome of Mush (1200-1202). If we add to this the cost of preparing the skins, copying the manuscript, decorating the pages and binding the book, we can begin to understand why a handwritten vellum manuscript was so expensive.</p>
                    <p id="fn2"><strong>[2]</strong> Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus (1466-1536), Dutch Roman Catholic priest and theologian, humanist during the European Renaissance.</p>
                    <p id="fn3"><strong>[3]</strong> For example, Martin Luther's German translation of the Bible, completed in 1534, ran 377 editions before his death. This translation virtually created the literary German language in the wealth of diverse dialects.</p>
                    <p id="fn4"><strong>[4]</strong> The wars between the Ottomans and Safavids ended in May 1639 when the two empires signed the Treaty of Zuhab (or Qasr'i Shirin) and brought some eighty years of relative peace to the shattered region. According to this settlement Armenia was divided between the two empires: the east was granted to the Persian Empire, and the west to the Ottoman. The plain of Shirak became the border between the two; Kars was handed to the Ottomans and the areas east of Ani to the Persians.</p>
                    <p id="fn5"><strong>[5]</strong> In the twelfth century, the relations between the Armenian Church and the Roman Catholic Church entered a new phase when Levon Prince of Cilician Armenia, single-mindedly pursued his goal to promote his rule to a kingdom. Levon strived to obtain the Holy Roman Emperor's sponsorship, but knowing that at the time all grants of ruling positions were confirmed and blessed by the Pope, accepting the crown meant that Levon, his Kingdom and the Armenian Church, would become subject to the Roman Catholic Church. During the ongoing negotiations, the leaders of the Armenian Church attempted to attain doctrinal unity, but declined to accept Rome's demands, because they considered them to be unilateral.</p>
                    <p id="fn6"><strong>[6]</strong> The Vulgate is the Latin translation of the Holy Bible that was completed by St. Jerome in the fourth century by the order of Pope Damasus. The purpose of this translation was to consolidate and combine various other translations that were in use at the time. The Council of Trent (1545-1563) designated the Vulgate as the official and definitive Latin translation of the Holy Bible.</p>
                    <p id="fn7"><strong>[7]</strong> The Armenian Church did not attend the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451 because the Armenians were in the midst of a rebellion against Sassanid Persian rule. Nevertheless, the Armenian Church rejected the rulings of the Council on more than one occasion, considering them a reversal on the rulings made at Ephesus regarding Christ's perfect unity of nature.</p>
                    <p id="fn8"><strong>[8]</strong> During the eighteenth century, the weakening of the Armenian community in Amsterdam led to the closure of printing presses operating in that city. Many items of cultural value, among them the brass engravings of the World Atlas, were sold and exported. In 1751, Armenian merchants in Istanbul rediscovered those plates at the home of Bursalioglu Poghos, a colleague who had recently passed away. They purchase the plates from his widow for a “fair price” and send them to St. Lazar, with the recommendation that the Mekhitarists use them to reprint the Atlas. In 1754, the World Atlas is reprinted in Venice.</p>
                    <p id="fn9"><strong>[9]</strong> Key reasons were the dwindling Armenian population in Holland and also the fact that much of the market for Armenian books was far away. It took months for books to travel to their destination and several more for payments to arrive.</p>
