                    <h3>
                        Introduction
                    </h3>
                    <p>The <em>Sharakanots</em> (Շարակնոց) is the comprehensive collection of all canonical hymns and songs sung during the services of the Armenian Apostolic Church. From the 5th century onward, beginning with the founding of Armenian literature by Sts. Mesrop Mashtots (Մեսրոպ Մաշտոց, 362-440) and Sahak Partev (Սահակ Պարթեւ, c 350- c. 438), the compendium of Armenian spiritual songs gradually grew and flourished. Over the centuries and after several reforms, it received its final organization and content.</p>
                    <h3>
                        Early Period
                    </h3>
                    <p>Christian ceremonies in the early centuries after Christ were greatly influenced by Jewish customs and worship. The majority of spiritual singing consisted of psalms and prophetic hymns of praise. The New Testament contains several references to this subject. For example, in St. Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the apostle exhorts: "<i>Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>"</p>
                    <p>During the 4th and 5th centuries, the Church Fathers began composing short songs that followed the psalms and hymns. These songs were called <em>ktsurd</em> or <em>ktsord</em> (կցուրդ, կցորդ), meaning "attachment", which were generally paraphrases of the psalms preceding them, naturally deriving their spirit of expression from the same psalms or hymns.</p>
                    <p>The creation of <em>ktsurds</em> is traditionally attributed to Mesrop Mashtots, Sahak Partev, Movses Khorenatsi (Մովսէս Խորենացի, c. 410-c. 490), and Hovhan Mandakuni (Յովհան Մանդակունի, 403-490). "<i>...They arranged and sang the hymns and set the melodies, which were divided among each other by the holy Patriarch Sahak Partev.</i>"</p>
                    <p>Gradually, the <em>ktsurds</em> evolved beyond their original limited scope; growing rich and developed, expanding their themes based on the Holy Scriptures, or praising the exemplary lives of saints or martyrs.</p>
                    <h3>
                        Hymnal of Barsegh Jon
                    </h3>
                    <p>Thanks to the development of the <em>ktsurd</em>, a surge in the creation of spiritual songs was recorded. Until the 7th century, spiritual songs did not follow a mandatory canon or order. In various regions of Armenia, musicians composed <em>ktsurds</em> for practical purposes and sang them during church services, hoping that these songs would be accepted by the Church.</p>
                    <p>Although this creative and poetic freedom enriched church singing, it also caused confusion during ceremonies. One such confusion occurred during the time of Catholicos Nerses III Tayetsi (Ներսէս Տայեցի, circa 661), prompting the first major reform of Armenian spiritual music.</p>
                    <p>It is recorded that on the Feast of Vardavar, Nerses III was at the Church of St. John (Ս. Յովհաննէս Տաճար) in Bagrevand (Բագրեւանդ), where the celebration of Christ's Transfiguration was performed. When it came time for the <em>ktsurd</em> of the "Harts" (Հարց), one choir began to sing the hymn but the other could not respond because they were not familiar with that hymn, so they responded with another <em>ktsurd</em>. This confusion continued several times as the choirs made their way through the service.</p>
                    <p>In 645, at the council held in the capital of Dvin (Դուին or Դվին), Catholicos Nerses, along with other reforms strengthing church discipline, decreed that the <em>ktsurd</em> sung in churches must conform to a mandatory canon. With the approval of this council, he ordered "<i>to select the worthy and teach only that.</i>"</p>
                    <p>The selection of worthy <em>ktsurds</em> was entrusted to the prelate of the Shirak seminary (Red Monastery), a vardapet (վարդապետ, doctor of theology) named Barsegh Jon (Բարսեղ Ճոն), who "<i>enjoyed great skill and sanctity.</i>" Thus, the first collection of ktsurds selected by patriarchal authority was formed, called the "Jonentir Ktsurdaran” (Ճոնընտիր Կցուրդարան), meaning arranged by Jon. Any supplements made thereafter were always confirmed by patriarchal authority.</p>
                    <p>After the completion of the <em>Jonentir</em> hymnal, Catholicos Nerses ordered that henceforth all churches must sing the same <em>ktsurds</em> during ceremonies and selected skilled officials to travel across the realm to spread the <em>Johnentir ktsurds</em> and teach the singing.</p>
                    <h3>
                        Stepanos Syunetsi
                    </h3>
                    <p>The second reform in Armenian spiritual music occurred in the 8th century by Stepanos Syunetsi (Ստեփանոս Սիւնեցի, 685-735). Syunetsi was the son of a senior priest of the cathedral of Dvin, received his education in the Catholicosate, and later in the seminaries of Makenats (Մաքենաս) and Syunik (Սիւնիք). Syunetsi entered service in the Catholicosate where he excelled in the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                    <p>During a dispute with prince Smbat Bagratuni (Սմբատ Բագրատունի), the ruler of Dvin, Syunetsi felt the need to further his Greek learning. He secretly fled Dvin for Constantinople, where he studied under a monastic scholar skilled in external philosophies. He continued his studies in Athens and then in Rome. While in Greece, he translated various Greek books into Armenian. In 728 (after 15 years), he returned to Armenia.</p>
                    <p>According to historian Stepanos Orbelyan (Ստեփանոս Օրբելեան, 1250-1303), Syunetsi, based on the system of rules established by Andrew of Crete (Ἀνδρέας Κρήτης, 8th century), introduced the present order of canonical hymns into the Armenian Church. This system was gradually accepted and stabilized, reaching its final form by the 10th century.</p>
                    <p>According to this system, each feast has its own canon, and each canon has its own separate hymns that establish the series of songs for the feast day’s hours. Each canon song is called a <em>sharakan</em> (շարական), and the complete collection of canons is called <em>Sharaknots</em> (Շարակնոց, book of sharakans).</p>
                    <p>After the establishment of canons, hymn writers worked to create a series of songs for different feasts, forming collections with the number of songs required by the canons. The <em>ktsurd</em> songs turned into <em>sharakans</em>, and the old word fell out of use in daily practice, remaining only as <em>ktsurd</em> meaning <em>psalm</em>.</p>
                    <p>New spiritual songs were written as canonical sharakans, and although sung after the blessings and psalms of the Bible, they became more independent in character than before. Ultimately, in the hours service, primary importance was given to the new songs, while the psalms were no longer read entirely but only as beginnings, short phrases sung before the sharakans, such as the Psalm 93, which is sung before Resurrection Midday hymns.</p>
                    <p>The following example is the Midday Hymn for Resurrection Sundays, Mode 3:</p>
                    <p>The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty.</p>
                    <p>Let us sing praises to the eternal king<br>who took flesh from the Virgin,<br>he established the world on faith unshakable;<br>to him be glory now and forever.</p>
                    <p>Of his own will God the Word suffered the death of the cross,<br>he shed his Holy Blood for the salvation of the universe;<br>to him be glory now and forever.</p>
                    <p>Glory to the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit;<br>Now and forever and ever and ever, amen.</p>
                    <p>As God he rose from the new tomb,<br>he adorned his Holy Church with radiant light<br>for the glory and praise for his name;<br>to him be glory now and forever.</p>
                    <h3>
                        Khlktsi Sharaknots
                    </h3>
                    <p>The third reform of the Sharakanots occurred during the 13th-14th centuries in Sis (Սիս), capital of the Armenian Kingdom in Cilicia. This reform was the result of the work of Grigor Khul (Գրիգոր Խուլ), who earned this nickname <em>Khul</em>, meaning deaf, because he put wax in his ears "<i>so as not to hear the worldly noise.</i>"</p>
                    <p>Khul edited the musical notes (neumes) of the pre-Nerses Shnorhali (Ներսէս Շնորհալի, 1102-1173) Sharakanots. As a passionate defender of the authenticity of traditional Armenian spiritual music and singing, Khul advanced the art of sharakans while preserving its pure Armenian spirit.</p>
                    <p>Copies of Khul's Sharakanots were highly respected by scribes for their quality. Numerous manuscript colophons show that from the 14th century onward, scribes emphasized the pedigree and completeness of their copy by stressing that their manuscripts were copied from Grigor Khul's.</p>
                    <p>For example, in the colophon of a Gospel copied in Sis in 1311, it says: "<i>Wrote these temperate letters in our Armenian year 744 (ՉՀԴ - 1311), in the capital Sis, under the protection of the Holy Sign, by the hand of the sinful and unworthy priest Sargis, from a good and select script, called Khuluk.</i>"</p>
                    <h3>
                        Latest Editions
                    </h3>
                    <p>Later editions of the Sharakanots were made by Gevorg Skevratsi (Գէորգ Սկեւռացի, 1246-1301) and by Grigor Tatevatsi (Գրիգոր Տաթեւացի, 1346-1409). Skevratsi further developed Khul's work, using improved musical notation principles to combine the art of pronunciation and intonation in songs. "<i>For the art of intonation is mixed into the songs, as the same example of Khul was set by Vardapet Gevorg.</i>"</p>
                    <p>The final selection of sharakans was made by Grigor Tatevatsi. His task was, according to the liturgical needs of his time, to improve the Sharakanots to ensure uniformity in the singing of the sharakans. The result of his work is seen in his <em>Book of Questions</em> (Գիրք Հարցմանց), where he presents the list of authors and the general list of the canons comprising the Sharakanots. Tatevatsi concludes the chapter with the words: "<i>This many sharakans are acceptable to the church, and more than this is to be rejected and considered useless.</i>"</p>
                    <h3>
                        Canon of the Martyrs of the Great Genocide
                    </h3>
                    <p>Although Tatevatsi's statement was accurate for his time, the establishment of canons did not preclude the introduction of new canons or sharakans for the simple reason that a living Church can always establish commemorations or feasts for new saints, such as the testimony of those martyred for faith and homeland during the Genocide of 1915.</p>
                    <p>In 2014, by the order of Garegin II, Catholicos of All Armenians, an editorial committee composed a new canon dedicated to the Witnesses of the Genocide that suited "<i>the solemn style of our ancient sharakans.</i>"</p>
                    <h3>
                        Non-Canonical Hymns
                    </h3>
                    <p>Due to the changes and selections made over the centuries, many spiritual songs, ktsurds, and sharakans have been excluded from the official Sharaknots collection. These hymns are known as <em>parakanon</em> (պարականոն), meaning non-canonical or apocryphal. Although non-canonical sharakans are no longer part of the Armenian Apostolic Church's liturgical singing, they are an important and inseparable part of the development and heritage of Armenian spiritual music. While many of these songs have been lost over centuries, many others can still be found in old manuscript collections.</p>
                    <h3>
                        Authors of the Sharakan
                    </h3>
                    <p>Authors of sharakans composed the spiritual songs of the Armenian Church from the 5th through the 15th centuries. According to Grigor Tatevatsi, "<i>They drank from the sources of the Holy Spirit and from time to time sang select sharakans</i>," meaning they drew inspiration from the Holy Spirit and occasionally sang melodic sharakans.</p>
                    <p>Tatevatsi continues and adds a list of twenty three composers of sharakan, starting with the founders of Armenian education and literature, Sts. Mesrop Mashtots and Sahak Part’ev. Tatevatsi’s list remained unchanged over centuries, was copied into manuscripts, and later printed at the beginning of Sharaknots editions.</p>
                    <p>However, the information regarding the authorship of sharakans published in the preface of the Sharaknots is mostly traditional. The list mentions who composed which canon or sharakan, but there is no doubt that there are authors whose works are included, but whose names are not on the list. Some authors have been attributed sharakans which, from the viewpoint of time, style, and language, cannot be correct.</p>
                    <p>Over the centuries, ktsurds and sharakans were presented only as liturgical or ritual collections in manuscripts or in printed form. There are no examples where the names of authors are directly linked to any specific sharakan.</p>
                    <h3>
                        Themes of the Sharakans
                    </h3>
                    <p>The themes of the sharakans are divided into three main groups:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hymns dedicated to Dominical feasts.</li>
                        <li>Hymns dedicated to Mary, the Mother of God.</li>
                        <li>Hymns dedicated to national and ecumenical spiritual fathers, rulers, and martyrs for the faith.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The first group includes many of the sharakans that are sung during Sunday services, such as the Midday Hymns (ճաշու շարական) during Resurrection Sunday (Յարութեան Կիրակիներ) liturgies. These sharakans often emphasize the doctrine of the Armenian Church.</p>
                    <p>An example is the Blessing (Օրհնութիւն) sharakan <em>Great and Wonderful Mystery</em> (Խորհուրդ Մեծ եւ Սքանչելի) that is sung on the Feast of Nativity, which challenges heretical ideas of the 5th century. In the third verse the hymn sings: "<i>Without departing from the Father, He sat at the holy manger</i>," meaning Jesus took on flesh and became man without separating from the Father or losing his divinity.</p>
                    <p>The second group of hymns includes the Magnificat (Մեծացուսցէ) sharakans, dedicated to the Holy Virgin. Examples of these are the Nativity midday sharakans <em>The Mother of Unutterable Light</em> (ԶԱնճառելի Լուսոյ Մայր) and <em>The Holy Mother of God We Bless and Magnify</em> (Սուրբ Զաստուածածինն Օրնհութեամբ Մեծացուցանեմք).</p>
                    <p>An example from the third group is the sharakan <em>It is Amazing to Me</em> (Զարմանալի Է Ինձ) dedicated to St. Vahan Gohtnetsi (Վահան Գողթնեցի, 700-737). The hymn was composed by Khosrovidukht (Խոսրովիդուխտ) who lived in the 8th century. According to tradition, the latter was the sister of the martyred saint Vahan Gohtnetsi. She composed the praise to her brother on the occasion of his martyrdom in 737, which the Armenian Church accepted into the Sharakanots.</p>
                    <h3>
                        The Feast of the Holy Cross
                    </h3>
                    <p>The feasts of the Holy Cross were established by the Armenian Church in the 7th century. The reason for this was the capture of Christ’s Cross by the Persians and its liberation by the Byzantines. During these wars Armenian divisions sided with the Byzantines. When a peace treaty was signed between the warring empires, the Persians agreed to return the captive Holy Cross, which arrived with a procession in the Karin (Կարին) province of Armenia, creating great enthusiasm. From there, the Holy Cross continued its journey to Constantinople and then to Jerusalem. Thanks to these historical events, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross was established.</p>
                    <p>Catholicos Sahak Dzorapetsi (Սահակ Ձորափորեցի, cir. 677-703), having great admiration for the Holy Cross, composed the sharakans of the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, as well as the <em>Shoghakat of Ejmiatsin</em> (Էջմիածնայ Շողակաթի) sharakan. Familiar sharakans include the Feast of the Exaltation sharakan <em>Your Immaculate Arms</em> (Որ Զանարատ Բազուկս Քո), <em>Victorious and New Blessing</em> (Յաղթող եւ Զնոր Օրհնութիւն), and the hymns dedicated to Shoghakat </em>Rejoyce, O Holy Church</em> (Ուրախ Լեր Սուրբ Եկեղեցի) and <em>The Only Begotten Descended from the Father</em> (Էջ Միածինն Ի Հօրէ).</p>

                        Appendix 1 - Composers of Sharakans
                    </h2>
                    <p>The following is a reasonable translation of the list of composers of sharakans compiled by St. Grigor Tat'evatsi. </p>

                    <h2>Appendix 2 - Beginnings of Sharakans in a Canon</h2>
                    <p>The following is a listing of Prophetic hymns and Psalms that are sung before canonical hymns or sharakans during services of the Armenian Apostolic Church.</p>
                    <p>Of these, the Orhnutyun is sung during night services. The Harts, Magnificat, Voghormya, Ter Herknits and Mankoonk' are sung during morning services. The Chashoo hymns are sung during midday services. The Hampartzi is sung during evening services.</p>
                    <p>In the past, the canon of hymns was comprised of nine parts, however the part known as Gordzk (Գործք) or Gortzatoon (Գործատուն) was later combined with the Harts sharakan and ceased to be independent.</p>
